461.55,4.039999999999964,"environment that concerned for other people and trying to set an example"
466.31,2.3999999999999773,"Part of that example was to his own church"
468.91,6.759999999999991,"Francis famously derided the wealth and the lace and the frills that come with the papacy. He'd wear simpler outfits"

496.67,5.919999999999959,"I think Francis was too radical for the conservatives in the church and not radical enough for the reformers in the church"
502.71,6.2000000000000455,"But certainly his impulse was towards reform within Catholicism and he will be remembered for that"
509.47,5.519999999999982,"So even among regular people you can kind of see the debates taking shape on what his future legacy might be"
514.99,6.480000000000018,"Yes, it's been fascinating to reflect on how much he changed the tone of the church without changing the underlying rules of the church"

547.79,5.480000000000018,"Of course many people come from all around the world including President Trump and then what about the conclave that comes after?"
553.83,8.599999999999909,"Well, it's the largest conclave in history. Pope Francis has appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals who can vote in the conclave"
562.59,3.159999999999968,"Here's Austin ivory Pope Francis's biographer"
565.87,8.240000000000009,"He's appointed so many cardinals who are from far-flung places often with very small Catholic populations who are on the frontier of"
575.43,6.800000000000068,"Interreligious dialogue or war or suffering anyway the realities of the world so that they bring those realities into the room"
582.31,8.360000000000014,"So even if Francis chooses cardinals with a similar outlook experts say many will still differ and view on some of the huge range of issues"
590.67,5.280000000000086,"And there's really no guarantee that the conclave will choose a more liberal Pope like Francis"
595.95,5.67999999999995,"Yeah, it is a fascinating choice to be watching NPR's Ruth Sherlock. Thanks so much. Thank you"

630.75,7.32000000000005,"So what are the basics of the case before the court at the center of the case is the school system in our own nearby Montgomery County, Maryland"
638.07,5.319999999999936,"And it's the most religiously diverse county in the United States of America"
643.47,6.7999999999999545,"It has a hundred and sixty thousand students of almost all faiths and on one side our parents who want to up their"

659.75,4.600000000000023,"Contend that the books expose their children to ideas that contradict their religious values"

669.51,6.240000000000009,"Her daughter was ten when the LGBTQ books were introduced in their curriculum"
675.75,6.720000000000027,"Okay, so rather than risk exposure to the unwanted ideas Morrison is homeschooling her daughter and here she is"
682.47,2.480000000000018,"It's just very heartbreaking to me"
684.95,6.519999999999982,"How many parents feel like they're have to choose between educating their child and raising their children in their faith?"
691.47,4.600000000000023,"And what she really wants to do is to have her kid in the public school"
696.47,4.559999999999945,"And be able to say that when certain material is discussed at all"
701.03,3.6800000000000637,"The kid will be opted out of class and go to a different classroom"
704.71,3.199999999999932,"Has the school board been any effort to accommodate that point of view?"
708.11,5.67999999999995,"Well, the board initially did allow opt-outs, but it says it became just unmanageable"
714.79,4.8799999999999955,"Unlike a sex ed class for example where the school system does allow opt-outs"
719.87,6.1200000000000045,"The boards has it became a logistical nightmare to take children out of a classroom when a single storybook that"
725.99,6.319999999999936,"features some same-sex parent or gay and lesbian kids could come up at any time"
732.79,3.6000000000000227,"And then there's the question of where do you draw the line?"
736.39,6.560000000000059,"Could parents opt their kids out of a science class where Darwin's theory of evolution is being taught"
742.95,5.839999999999918,"Or a history class where there's a section on how women got out of the kitchen and into the workforce"
748.79,3.6800000000000637,"These are things that are against some people's religious views"
752.47,2.9599999999999227,"Well, what is the law set up to now before this case?"
755.51,5.440000000000055,"Well, I talked to Yale law professor Justin Driver who's written extensively about the history of public schools"
760.95,5.599999999999909,"And he says that generally these curriculum decisions are left to local school boards"
766.55,5.280000000000086,"Unless there's some effort to coerce students into accepting a religious belief"
772.47,3.759999999999991,"He defends the way the Montgomery County system has handled this issue"
776.63,4.240000000000009,"It seems to me that the process is working as it should"
781.83,2,"Rather than empowering"
784.39,5.600000000000023,"individual parents or students to be able to control it people have raised objections"
790.47,4.720000000000027,"The school district has heard those objections and modified their practice"
795.51,2.7200000000000273,"So we've heard the facts in this case. We've heard a little bit of the history"
798.31,4.880000000000109,"What happens when you take those facts and that history and put it before these particular nine justices?"
803.51,2.159999999999968,"Well answering that question is dangerous"
805.67,1.0400000000000773,"You know"
806.71,5.1200000000000045,"My guess is that a majority of the justices will side with the objectors who want an opt out"
811.91,1.9200000000000728,"But that's not a certainty"
813.83,6.7999999999999545,"I draw that conclusion mainly because the majority of the court has had little exposure to attending a public school themselves"
820.79,2.32000000000005,"I don't know where they sent their kids to school"
823.67,6.160000000000082,"But only three of the justices went to public schools. The other six all attended private catholic schools"
